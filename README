= Goals =

A self contained, portable CNC device that can (in order of importance)

* 3D print
* laser cut paper
* mill pcbs

= Why =

CNC's, their design, build, maintenance and running is like catnip for all types of engineers. I use all three devices frequently enough to warrant having such a device.

And because i can.

= Design =

== Assumptions ==

To make the print easy to store and be portable at the same time, it makes sense to enclose it within a case of some kind. (not the popfab, http://vimeo.com/45911972,  was in large part inspiration for this. However no documentation exists for the design or build).

Due to this requirement, the type of kinematics to use becomes obvious; a delta or polar kinematics system would be too large or incredibly difficult to implement.

Supporting all three uses on one head is also orders-of-magnitude more difficult, so a swappable head system a la popfab will be employed.

Finally, due to the multi-use nature of the device, one design constraint seems to be the bed size; ie it must be able to handle all three use cases. Standard paper sizes in the EU are A4, so this will be the size aimed for.

* Use an aluminium storage case as enclosure
* Traditional serial kinematics
* A4 bed
** Must be heated for 3D printing
* Multiple replaceable heads

=== Design Refinements ===

** X folds down flat

ALUMINIUM ELECTRICIAN LOCKABLE FLIGHT CASE TOOL CHEST BOX BRIEFCASE

Advertised dimensions: 18 X 13 X 6 INCH'S

Measured dimensions: 

case_width  = 460;
case_depth  = 330;
case_height = 160;

== A4 Bed ==

A4 = 210 x 297 mm

The RepRap site has an example of an A4 heated bed

== Hotends ==

All metal hot end chosen for future filament materials experimentation. Also no danger of borking the hot end from accidental high temps

The choice was between the E3D and prusa:

* https://www.reprapsource.com/en/show/6891

both have their quirks, though the E3D hotend is better documented. In the end i chose the E3D because of that, and the its availability. The prusa hotend is believed to be superior but it wasnt available, and i dont think i'll ever be printing to a level where i will extract the full potential of it.
